Hi, I’m @Scitinz.

I'm interested in embedded systems and low level computation. I write HDL, as well as code for Raspberry Pi's and similar. I am proficient in other languages as well
such as C#, Java, and Python to enable higher level interactions, website building, and produce more complex programs not possible at the lower level.
